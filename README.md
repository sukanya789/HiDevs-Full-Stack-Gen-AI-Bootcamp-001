 WEEK_3 : Problem Statement 1: Managing Personal Information with Python
Overview
This problem involves creating a Python class to manage personal information, including names and dates of birth. The class should handle input from the console, display dates of birth when names are entered, and handle secret dates of birth by displaying "secret" instead. All data should be persisted and loaded, with support for adding to the list.

Solution
The solution includes a class named PersonalInfoManager that encapsulates the functionality. It utilizes a data structure to store personal information and persists the data in a file (problem1_data_file.pickle). Error handling, input validations, and retry mechanisms are implemented to ensure robustness and user-friendly interaction.

Problem Statement 2: Compact Address Book Management
Overview
This problem focuses on creating a compact address book management system using Python. The address book class should store information such as first name, last name, street address, city, state, country, mobile number, and email. It should accept input from the console, store data in memory and disk, prevent duplicate email/phone numbers, and optimize memory usage.

Solution
The solution involves an AddressBook class designed to efficiently manage contact information. It accepts user input, stores data both in memory and on disk (problem2_data_file.pickle), and prevents duplicate email/phone numbers. The class includes functions to find occurrences of first name, last name, and street address, along with a combined function for all three tasks. Error handling, input validations, and retry mechanisms ensure a smooth user experience.

These solutions adhere to the specified requirements, incorporating user input, proper error handling, and optimizations for efficient performance. The code is organized into classes and functions for modularity and readability. Additionally, data persistence and input validations enhance the robustness of the solutions.
